### House price predictor
SoundWrite is a web application which was made to assist the user to take notes on audiobooks. This project is being developed to address the issue of quality education which is part of the United Nations Sustainablity Development Goals. Audiobooks are a vital educational tool for people with learning disabilities such as dyslexia. Although there are various audiobook providers out there, Soundwrites main focus was on the educational side of things which created a strong emphasis around the note taking element.
