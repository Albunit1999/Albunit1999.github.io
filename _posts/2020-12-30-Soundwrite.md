## How to Use This Theme
Just go ahead and read up on [how to install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's not too hard I promise!

Download this repository [here](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively) and save it to any folder you want.

Open a terminal window or a command line and ```cd``` to that location.

Then enter: ```bundle exec jekyll serve```. You can now access your new Jekyll site from [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/). Have fun exploring your new site!

## Features

```


### Formspring integration
The contact form below each page on the footer actually collects information! Just change your email address in the ```_config.yml``` file!

## <blockquote> woah <blockquote/>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic02.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>In both layman and nerd-speak, this is a paragraph. This is a paragraph that goes on the right side of an image. This is the text that goes under the heading and the subtitle. Paragraphs vary in length but in school we're taught to make them at least 7 sentences or else we risk getting a C. Since the paragraph didn't have a thesis or a closing argument, it's probably a C grade paragraph.</p>
