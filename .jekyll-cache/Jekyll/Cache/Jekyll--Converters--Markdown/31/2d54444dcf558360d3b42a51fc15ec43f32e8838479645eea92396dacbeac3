  <h2>Python vs Java</h2>
  <h4>The main differences</h4>
  </header>
<p>Well the main differnece is to do with how they are typed (static vs dynamic.) </p>
<p>Java is a statically typed and compiled language, whereas Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This  seems to be where all the differnce lies which makes the langues so different. Because Java is staticically typed and compiled, it is a lot faster than Python. So Pyhton is better right?</p>
<p> Well its not that simple..unlike Python. Because Python's syntax is so simple, when you're developing software code, it's clean and doesn't seem complex unlike other languages like Java and C++. This feature also makes the maintenance of the code way easier and just generally better to use for most people and companies. Easier maintenance means cheaper in the long-run and when good time complexity isnt really an aim,
  Python is the go to langauge. Python in a lot of peoples eyes takes the win and because of the versatility of the language, advancements in Ai are usually coded with Python. And learning it after being a fairly decent Java developer is a walk in the park.

  <h2>A Big Example</h2>
  <h4>This pretty much sums up the everything</h4>
  </header>
  <p><span class="image left"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PythonString.png" alt="" /></span>For the back-end we utilise Java Spring boot couple with Azure cloud services. We also use Spring security for the log in flow using JWT authentication tokens. Each time a user logs in, a new token is generated and stored in the users cache. Once this token is stored, it is sent to the back-end using a post request via axios. This returned the users data. How difficult was this? .... Very, considering it was my first big project (like most of my team) and having to create a complicated full stack application from scratch was extremely challenging.
