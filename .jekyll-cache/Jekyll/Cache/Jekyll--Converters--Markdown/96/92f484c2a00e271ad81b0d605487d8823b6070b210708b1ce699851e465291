  <h2>Python vs Java</h2>
  <h4>The main differences</h4>
  </header>
<p>Well the main differnece is to do with how they are typed (static vs dynamic.) </p>
<p>Java is a statically typed and compiled language, whereas Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This  seems to be where all the differnce lies which makes the langues so different. Because Java is staticically typed and compiled, it is a lot faster than Python. So Pyhton is better right?</p>
<p> Well its not that simple..unlike Python. Because Python's syntax is so simple, when you're developing software code, it's clean and doesn't seem complex unlike other languages like Java and C++. This feature also makes the maintenance of the code way easier and just generally better to use for most people and companies. Easier maintenance means cheaper in the long-run and when good time complexity isnt really an aim,
  Python is the go to langauge. Python in a lot of peoples eyes takes the win and because of the versatility of the language, advancements in Ai are usually coded with Python. And learning it after being a fairly decent Java developer is a walk in the park.

  <h2>A Big Example</h2>
  <h4>This pretty much sums up the everything</h4>
  </header>
  <p><span class="image left"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/JavaString.png" alt="" /></span>The goal here is to print "hello world" backwards. Pretty easy right? So for all my Java people you can see whats going on here. A  simple class, with a method returning a string. we have a new String builder, and in the method we have for loop.
  The for loop wil be the length of the String used, and it basically iterates backwards producing the string inputted backwards. In the main method below we create a String variable and set it to "hello world" and using system.out.println we put that variable inside the method and the output will be hello world backwards. Thats how you do it in Java!
  </p>


  And now... in Python

  <p><span class="image right"><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/PythonString.png" alt="" /></span>For the front-end we used React. As we found out, using React and Spring Boot together isn't the most popular combination which made things extremely difficult as there wasn't much content out there to aid us. However, React as a front end framework proved extremely versatile and through the use of axios we were able to perform POST and GET requests to connect with the back-end all while having a sleek user friendly interface.
