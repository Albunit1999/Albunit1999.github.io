  <h2>Python vs Java</h2>
  <h4>The main differences</h4>
  </header>
<p>Well the main differnece is to do with how they are typed (static vs dynamic.) </p>
<p>Java is a statically typed and compiled language, whereas Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This  seems to be where all the differnce lies which makes the langues so different. Because Java is staticically typed and compiled, it is a lot faster than Python. So Pyhton is better right?</p>
<p> well its not that simples..unlike Pyhton. Because Pythons syntax is so simple when you're developing software code, it's clean and does not seem complex unlike other languages like Java and C++. This feature also makes the maintenance of the code way easier and just generally better to usse for most people and companies. Easier maintenance means cheaper in the long-run and when time complexity isnt really an aim,
  Python is the go to langauge. Pyhton in a lot of peoples eyes takes the win and because of the versatility of the language, advancements in Ai are usually coded with Python. And learning it after being a fairly decent Java developer is a walk in the park.
