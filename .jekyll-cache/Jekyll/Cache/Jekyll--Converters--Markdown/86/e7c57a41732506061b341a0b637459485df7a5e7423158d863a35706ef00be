  <h2>Python vs Java</h2>
  <h4>The main differences</h4>
  </header>
<p>Well the main differnece is to do with how they are typed (static vs dynamic.) </p>
<p>Java is a statically typed and compiled language, whereas Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This  seems to be where all the differnce lies which makes the langues so different. Because Java is staticically typed and compiled, it is a lot faster than Python.</p>
